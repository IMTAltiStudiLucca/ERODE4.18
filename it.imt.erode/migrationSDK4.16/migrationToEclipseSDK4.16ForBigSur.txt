Eclipse SDK 4.16 

1)
Downloaded eclipse SDK 4.16 from https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/R-4.16-202006040540/ (via https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/index.html)

2) Edited Info.plist in Contents. I added
<string>-vm</string><string>/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_191.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java</string>			
in 
<key>Eclipse</key>
		<array>

You might also need to do from terminal xattr -cr ERODE.app
		
3) I installed XTEXT through add new software (https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/download.html, releases)

4) I installed NEBULA widgets through add new software (https://www.eclipse.org/nebula/downloads.php)

5) I imported all projects from workspace ERODE473a, closing all projects but erode and the xtext ones

6) I run ChemicalReactionNetwork.xtext of it.imt.erode.crn

7) I removed some warnings from 'imports'

8) I opened all feature, platform and product project general or for macosx. I cleaned all projects

9) Project it.imt.erode.crn.platform.feature had a number of warnings:	
31 plugin references could not be resolved 
 (see migrationToEclipseSDK4.16ForBigSur_warnings_it.imt.erode.crn.platform.feature_.txt)

10) I went to it.imt.erode.crn.product/ERODE.product, In tab overview I clicked on Cross Platform Wiki Page, and I followed the instructions of 'Multi-platform builds'

11) I closed it.imt.erode.crn.platform.feature and I reopened it. 5 warnings were solved. I still had 26. After cleaning all projects we still have 26 warnings.
I removed all of them from tab 'feature.xml' (see removedPluginsMigrationSDK4.16.txt)


12) I opened ERODE.product of macosx. I clicked on Launch Eclipse application. 
It gave some errors. I opened run configurations, ERODE.product, plug-ins. I removed tick from 'include optional dependencies when computing required plugins' and I clicked on 'add required plugins.
From 218 selected plugins (out of 459) I got 227.
These are the 9 added
1 org.apache.batik.constants
2 org.apache.batik.i18n
3 org.apache.commons.io
4 org.apache.xmlgraphics
5 org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs
6 org.eclipse.e4.ui.ide
7 org.eclipse.equinox.supplement
8 org.eclipse.ui.genericeditor
9 org.eclipse.urischeme

Instead, with 'include optional...' we get 233 plugins.

13) I added the 9 plugins in tab included plugins of it.imt.erode.crn.platform.feature

14)
Now, 
- Launch Eclipse application in ERODE.product of macosx works!
- Export product for macosx works!
	But I still have to modify by hands the info.plist
	
15)
I opened all the projects for the remaning platforms.
I have 3 warnings in it.imt.erode.crn.platform.win32.feature
Plug-in reference 'org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86' cannot be resolved	feature.xml	/it.imt.erode.crn.platform.win32.feature	line 24	Plug-in Problem
Plug-in reference 'org.eclipse.equinox.security.win32.x86' cannot be resolved	feature.xml	/it.imt.erode.crn.platform.win32.feature	line 31	Plug-in Problem
Plug-in reference 'org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86' cannot be resolved	feature.xml	/it.imt.erode.crn.platform.win32.feature	line 39	Plug-in Problem

The same happens if one tries to open linux32. Could it be

15)
If I export linux64 it seems ok.
If I export win64 I get an error
	Processing inclusion from feature org.eclipse.equinox.executable: Unable to find plug-in: org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86_64_1.1.1200.v20200508-1552. Please check the error log for more details.

16) 
I moved the workspace in dropbox and I changed the name of the folder. I got some new errors of missing plugins (11).
By closing all platform specific projects apart for the mac, I have 6 missing plugins in it.imt.erode.crn.platform.feature.
I did again step 10 (multiplatform)	. I had first to 'remove the update site' and to add it again.
I still had the warnings. I did 'clean' and they were gone.

17) Now exporting of mac and linux64 seem to work.
While win64 gives an error
