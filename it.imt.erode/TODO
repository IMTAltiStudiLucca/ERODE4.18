Double check if it is correct to invoke splittersGenerator.skipSplittersWhichShouldBeIgnored(); in refine of CRNBisimulations and CRNBisimulationsNAry
In general, check if we handle this properly

STEFANO:
- C'Ã¨ da aggiungere le initial conditions non zero per l'export modelica?!??


Check collapseAndAddReactions of CRN
Check collapseReactions of non massaction 

What about absolute value?
 
For simulateCTMC, for arbitrary reactions I compute the value considering only the rate, without doing other calculations, which instead are done for the mass-action reactions.
