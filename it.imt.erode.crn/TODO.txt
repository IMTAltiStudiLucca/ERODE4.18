Sundials does not work on my laptop at santanna (windows64, java 32)
	-The fact is that I downloaded erode-java-32 in my Windows 64 bits. Probably I distributed sundials 32 there, while I should have sundials 64
//TODO: SyntacticMarkovianBisimilarityNary
	REMOVE ARRAY speciesCounters[] AND PUT HashMap<ISpecies, ISpeciesCounterHandler> speciesCountersHM AS IN CRNBISIMULATIONNARY

load() has problems with more species in the same line.
	The problem is that it is difficult to handle both
		s1 s2
	and
		s1 = 3 * 2 s2
	A separator ';' at the end of each species would help		
I have to absolutely clean the code about exportLNA

JACOBIAN DOES NOT WORK!
The problem is with ODE format (or, more in general, non mass-action).
For now, I have added a check to rise an exception in case one tries to use it on non supported models. 
	I might implement an implicit MA-RN conversion
		begin model runningSymm
		begin init
		x1 = 200
		x2 = 100
		x3 = 100
		end init
		begin ODE
		d(x1) = -4*x1 + x2 + x3
		d(x2) = 2.00*x1 - x2
		d(x3) = 2.00*x1 - x3
		end ODE
		exportMatlab(fileOut="pino.m",tEnd=1,writeJacobian=true)
		write(fileOut="works.ode",format=MA-RN)
		end model

How to force the use of a particular version of Java:
Pass the following option using the ini file of Eclipse
-vm /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_144.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java

URGENT:
	preserva i parametri che vuoi mantanere facendo currying
	fai checkUniqueParameterToCurry simile a checkUniqueParameterToPerturb(with bound). And check if it has been done also for the parameters without bound 	
	
	Handle java.lang.outofmemoryerror: GC overhead exceeded
	Non generare file ridotto se non trovi riduzione
	Customize parser: http://www.euclideanspace.com/software/development/eclipse/xtext/grammar/index.htm
	BDE does not work with this model (because we can have 2-a = 0 or 2-b=0) 
		d(a) = 1/(2 - a)  
  		d(b) = 1/(2 - b) 
	CompactCSVMatrixImporter: //TODO: complete the creation of the prepartiti USER using b (maybe also a tolerance?)
	this view fails: test = max(species , 0)
	BNG BENCHMARKS (webpage with all the used BNG files)
	Expose exception: Hill not supported when loading BNG
	Expose exception: functions not supported when loading BNG
	consider simhya of Bortolussi for stochastic simulation. Apparently it is much more efficient than FERN (bikes model from Laura). Check performance of Bike733 mass action (delete min, and compute massaction), so to check if ERODE is slow due to arbitrary.
	CRNVectorField is now much more efficient for non-massaction CRNs. However, it will not work for species with names not supported by MathEval. Also, there might be problems with ODEs imported from MATLAB. rateLawsString has to be pre-processed in order to replace the names with the supported ones 
	RN encoding of power (x^2) does not work. Transform it in x*x
	export symbolic jacobian 
	Suppose you have an arbitrary reaction X1 + X2 -> X3 arbitrary X1*X2*k1
		This is actually a mass action CRN.
		Can we discover this and transform the reaction in mass action? Or at least raise a warning?
	

	Put libz3.dylib and libz3java.dylib in erode.app/Contents/MacOS
	check concentrations>0 (due to Jacobian) for pointryagin
	Exception not caught when exporting in matlab symmetricBindingSites8 and sx_EGFR.ode
	Fix creation of reactions in CRNImporter (and censequently in GUICRNImprter: create composite only for n-ary)
	Terminate loading of MRMC
	Generazione modello ridotto troppo lento
	Se carichi MRMC dando un .lab che non esiste si blocca	
	
	//Non fare sparire i parametri = 1.
	//I cannot use parameters as expononents!
	//Quando chiediamo di scrivere un file in una cartella che non esiste otteniamo una eccezione. Gestiscila e mostrala nel dialog! Cosa succede quando leggiamo un file che non esiste?	
	//The "multimodel" seems to work. However, all commands are executed in parallel. Sequenzialize them!
	//If we do the z3 partition refinement for regulatory boolean networks, forbid all things that cannot be used with a boolean network
	//Remove check "Source is in the hierarchy of the destination."
	//When creating .crn or ._ode files, we should use the short names format.
	//NO: Divide by multinomial in stochastic simulation
	//usa sirius per disegnare CRNs: https://eclipse.org/sirius/getstarted.html
	disable automatic validation after every change. Force it after save only.
	forbid symbolicparameters in views. We can use ReferenceToParameterOrSpecies
	export LBS: views and commands
	1. 
		FEM -> Jacobi
		AX -> affine
		importAffine(AMatrix="pippo.csv",bVector="")
		importJacobi(AMatrix="pippo.csv",bVector="")
		
		2. terminate reduced model
		
		3. 300 species e 300 reazioni sono ancora gestibili
		
		4 non creare .crn, ma ._ode. Serve poi un importer per leggerlo.
		
		5. opzione per scrivere ._ode disabilitato. Usa opzione per abilitarlo
		

	//Terminate ode
	//Problemi con file? importBNG(fileIn="BNGNet/pippo.net") does not work. Also, the relative path should start from the folder where the file il located    
	//buttons for reductions (bb=ic,fb=user). buttons for new project, new file
	//tell about termination button in the manual
	//per "disegnare" la crn, guarda post it: petri net + short cut per 1 -> 1, + short cut per catalytic
	//show error to user if unrecognized command
	//check outline/validation, because we are getting exception with importlbs
	//forbid var for non mass action 
	//Now, if we are asked to write a .ode file with more than 300 species/reactions we do a small model importing a .crn file.
		Instead of the .crn, we should write a ._ode, which is just a .ode with some constraints (each "line" should stay in a line) to allow for our direct parsing.
		We should implemented the parsing for ._ode files, and add a comment about these constraints at the beginning of the file. 
	//Syntactic check for preventing the user to use covariances or jacobians of non-mass action CRNs.x
	//Inject the terminator in other time-consuming operations (odes, and maybe also import)
	//Check PALOMAMomentClosureImporter, it is written terribly 
	//Generate Matlab file for allbdes/allfdes 
	//Confidence intervals, and copy new observer in a file of its own.
	//Button to close all the plotviews
	//K N1 N2 etc of Hill became keywords
	//Problem with p2 = 2*p1*p2 (recursion): check if a parameter appears in its own equation, and forbid it. We have problems with circular dependency... Thus, we should check if a parameter is defined in terms of a parameter defined later.
	//Problem with p = p2 p2 = p (cyclic definition)
	//Decrease number of parenthesis as done in GUICRNImporter
	//Synchronize file name with model name. When a file is renamed, rename the model... error if differ
	
	//In order to open a perspective: 
	try {
        IWorkbench workbench = PlatformUI.getWorkbench();
        workbench.showPerspective(EapPerspective.ID,
                workbench.getActiveWorkbenchWindow());
    } catch (WorkbenchException e) {

    }

	  //Transition matrix
	           q12 =  1  
	  q21 =  1                     
	   
	  q1Out = q12
	  q2Out = q21
	 end parameters
	 /*
	  * We have one species per square, representing the number of people in that square
	  */
	 begin init
	  s1 = ic1
	  s2 = ic2
	end init
	 /*
	  * The dynamics of people in each square
	  */
	 begin ODE
	  d(s1) = (2/**socialisation / N*/) * ( -s1*s1*q1Out +          s2*s2*q21)
	  d(s2) = (2/**socialisation / N*/) * ( -s2*s2*q2Out + s1*s1*q12         )
	 end ODE
	 simulateCTMC(tEnd=1.0 , viewPlot=true , viewLabels=true,repeats=10)
	end model


LESS URGENT:
	//Indent
	//Animation when drawing plot
	//Shall we handle "this" in a better way?
	//Flag polynomialODEs in ODE? So that we can use reduceBB/reduceFB and reduceNBB/reduceNFB?
	//We almost have a proper import. Select which formats we want to support. Also, maybe auto-completion might suggest the user to replace the load/import with the crn itself as we do now upon execution
	//I didn't manage to import the new crn format. Hence, I disabled "load" and "fileIn". The idea is that we use only the "importXXX" to use the other formats. While there is no reason to load other crn files. In case, I could implement some importing functionalities via xtext for the files in the same project.


//Define template to automatically provide begin parameters/species/views - end parameters/species/views: https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/304_ide_concepts.html#templates
//Improve warning of reductions: can we check when we have polynomial ODEs?
//Use images for the quickfixes etc
//Collapse expressions and expressionswithspecies and withcov



//we need to define a perspective/view for erode: the button (and any other view) should appear only there.
